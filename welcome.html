            It's easy to make fun of influencer marketing — we've all seen the Fyre Festival docs by now,<br/>
            right? But the shallow aspects of social media shouldn’t diminish the impact influencer marketing<br/>
            can have. There are plenty of authentic influencers who promote brands and their products.<br/>
            Traackr vets influencers and helps brands tap into their marketing powers in the right way.<br/>

            case studies, testimonials, and other data show how their services yield real results. <br/>
